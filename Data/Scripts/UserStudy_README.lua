	User Study
	v1.0
	by: standardcombo
	
	In the persuit of improving your games, the ability to directly observe
	players is invaluable. If you ask your community what to change about
	the game, they will most likely tell you things that are only relevant
	to them, players who are later in the experience. However, the most
	important part of a game to improve is the onboarding of new players.
	They will leave without ever telling you what was wrong and they won't
	come back.

	The User Study component allows you to directly observe new players,
	without their knowledge. Build an understand of where they are confused,
	struggling, and then engage them through in-game chat to further improve
	your understanding of the situation. This process can drive refinement
	of the game design and boost retention.
